SpreeDotpay
===========

A [Spree](http://spreecommerce.com) extension to allow payments using Dotpay.pl payment service.

Works with Rails 4.1 and Spree 2.4

Installation
------------

1. Add spree_dotpay to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_dotpay'
```

2. Bundle your dependencies:

```bundle install
```

3. Restart your server

Configuration
-------------
In the admin backend go to "Configuration" -> "Payment Methods" section and then create new payment method:
  - select Spree::OffsitePayment::Dotpay as a provider;
  - enter your Dotpay account_id and pin;
  - in the server_ips field you can specify Dotpay server IPs separated by commas (see Dotpay manual)

Usage
-----
A customer have 2 abilities to make a payment:
  - by pressing Dotpay link on the checkout payment page;
  - or in the usual manner: by pressing "save and continue" button on the checkout form. In this case the payment will be processed on the "confirm" step if it's present or on the "payment" step otherwise.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```
